## Hospital Nursing Intervention Pilot Program

#### Background:

As a Data Analyst within the Business Insights Group at ACME Integrated Delivery System, you're tasked with launching an intervention to increase nurse hiring in hospitals with Intensive Care Units (ICU) and Surgical Intensive Care Units (SICU). This initiative aims to enhance critical patient care in these facilities, driven by evidence showing improved outcomes with higher nurse to patient ratios.

#### Data and Process:

The analysis is supported by three tables:

Two dimension tables: business.csv and bed_type.csv.  
One fact table: bed_fact.csv.  

#### Tasks:

1. Dimension Identification:
- Identify dimensions from each dimension table.
- Determine which variables are facts vs. dimensions in the tables.
2. Fact Identification:
- Identify fact variables from the fact table based on their nature.
3.  Analysis for Leadership:
- Identify hospitals with ICU or SICU beds.
- Generate summary reports for License, Census, and Staffed beds for the top 10 hospitals.
4. Interpretation and Recommendations:
- Analyze findings and identify potential intervention pilot program candidates based on bed volume.
- Provide insights on hospitals appearing on multiple lists.
5. Drill Down Investigation and Final Recommendation:
- Investigate hospitals with sufficient ICU and SICU bed volumes.
- Tailor recommendations for Leadership based on identified hospitals' suitability for the intervention pilot program.

#### Final Recommendation:

Based on the analyses conducted, the recommended hospitals for the pilot intervention program are those with a substantial volume of both ICU and SICU beds, 
ensuring effective utilization of resources and maximal impact on patient care. Among the identified candidates, the top hospital showing consistent high volume across 
License, Census, and Staffed beds is **Universtiy of Maryland Medical Center**. These facilities exhibit robust infrastructure and bed capacity, 
making them optimal choices for initiating the nursing intervention pilot program.
