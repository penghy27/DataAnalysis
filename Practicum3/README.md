The NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) provides a dataset containing records of yellow and green taxi trips. The primary objective is to assess the factors influencing cab drivers' incentives, specifically, determining whether they receive a tip or not. This analysis aims to facilitate the development of a predictive model for estimating tip amounts in future trips.

For this particular use case, we will perform the analysis using the NYC Green Taxi Trip Records for 2018 and construct a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) regression model to forecast tip amounts.

Each question in the practicum adheres to the CRISP-DM framework. Below are the links to the Rmd and PDF files.
